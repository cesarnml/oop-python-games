## Introduction

- `Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)` is a software development technique.
- Before OOP, programmers relied on `procedural programming` (also called `structured programming`)
- If OOP is the solution, *what problem is it solving?*

## Part I: Introdocing Object-Oriented Programming

- OOP - objects with `state` and `behavior`

### Chapter 1: Procedural Python Examples (24 pages)

- Code reuse and association of data and method that manipulate the data is difficult in procedural programming
- Functions should *never* modify global variables.
